# Proxmox
I'll be using Proxmox v9.1.2 to develop my home server with installations such as JellyFin, Media automation, File Storage, and many more!! Proxmox is mainly used as my virtual environment creation to host multiple lightweight LXC &amp; VMs for my  testing purposes. Documenting all of this for my jorney.
