# Proxmox
I'll be using Proxmox v9.1.2 to develop my home server with installations such as JellyFin, Media automation, File Storage, and many more!! Proxmox is mainly used as my virtual environment creation to host multiple lightweight LXC &amp; VMs for my  testing purposes. Documenting all of this for my jorney.

# Hardware
Notes: I just bought an Optiplex and used leftover HDD that I had laying around. I won't be using a backup in this set up but if I would, I'd likely add a 2T HDD in the later future. Though it's entirely dependent on the power supply of the Optiplex that I purchased, it's still a really good chance that this could be supported. If the PSU doesn't support it, I may have to find an alternative to either 1. Replace the current PSU or 2. Utilize another PSU and provide the power there or 3. Find a reason to rebuild a computer because its cool but with $$$ as a downside... You could always spend more ;)

Intel i5 8500 (6 Core) @3.00GHz
16GB 2666mhz 
2x1T HDD
1x256 SSD
