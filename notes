downlaod and upload ubuntu serv 24.04 iso file to my local server.
created a ubuntu serv vm w/ 10gb ram and used nvme as storage
followed instructions on linux for setup + ssh selected.
linux loaded, went back to proxmox>vm>hardware> found and added pci device of my intel CoffeeLake 630 IGPU
also removed bootable device from cd/dvd drive
started linux again
once linux vm loaded, ran: 
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
```


i downloaded curl to download docker
```
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh
```

I ran following commands to manage docker as non-root in the group
'''
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
'''

i also need to mount the /data to the vm

I checked on /dev/dri and made sure card0 card1 and espeically renderD128 is found.
i ran sudo apt install intel-gpu-tools to download package. this package helps determine the resources used for transcoding later.M
